## **EurekaMine-MP** ##

The **best** Minecraft server software out there!
========
Have you ever debated between running a Minecraft PC server, or a Minecraft: Pocket Edition server, cause you couldn't afford both, or wanted players from both platforms to be able to socialize? Well now you have the best of both worlds. One server software that we think will make you get up and say "Eureka!". Basically, it's a server software, where both PC and PE players can play together, on one server! 

## Requirements ##

 - Java 1.8 (or higher)
 - Two open ports (One for MC PC and another for MCPE)
 - At least 1GB of RAM.
 - The Jar file for the version you want (Find them in releases)
 
 ## Plugins ##
 EurekaMine works with all simple Bukkit plugins.

## How To Install ##

To start the server for the first time, open your CMD (terminal, if you're on Linux) and navigate the location of the jar file. You can move around with: cd (folder name). Once you're in the folder of the jar file type : java -jar EurekaMine.jar. If you're on Windows, you can make things simpler for yourself, by making a batch file. To do this create a new text document and write "java -jar EurekaMine.jar". Do not add the quotes. Than go to "Save As" and name it: EurekaMine-MP.bat. Make sure that the file type is set to "All Files" and click save. After you start the server for the first time, several folders and files will be created in the folder of the jar file.
